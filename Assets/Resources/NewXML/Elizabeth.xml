      <subtitle>Please don't ask me about poor Richard. I'm much too distressed. Why, why don't you ask me about something else, let's lighten this up a little bit! Let's talk about me! I'm starring in a Broadway show soon! It's my first big role outside of Hollywood. My husband Richard never much liked my roles, he can be so jealous! What about you, then, stranger?</subtitle>

      <subtitle>Why, Hollywood, can't you tell? Richard and I met there a year back. I the young, beautiful, and talented actress, he the travelling business man. Oh! It was love at first sight. Well, maybe for one of us, that is. Richard insisted I come back with him to New York. He promised me a career here, at Broadway. So I left everything behind, never looking back.</subtitle>

      <subtitle>Why, Mister, I've come from sea to shining sea! I've danced my way into the spotlight! My career started in Hollywood...but Hollywood was too small for this girl! I dreamed of greener pastures, I dreamed of...Broadway! It just so happens I'm appearing as a star role in the dance musical Call Me Tico, surely you've heard of it? Well, I suppose you'll want an autograph from yours truly. I sign for all of my fans in lipstick...I...oh dear, I seem to have misplaced my lipstick, somewhere! Do let me know if you happen upon it. I might just give you a kiss to go along with that autograph.</subtitle>

      <subtitle>Yes, we were. And Richard loved me dearly. And his jealousy was just as strong as his love. But...it wasn't completely unjustified. A girl of my beauty and talent, how can men resist? I received more than a few letters from young men, some of which I may have continued correspondence with. But Richard! He found my letters, and I don't know what became of them! Maybe he burned them, or maybe he has them hidden away somewhere. Oh, I wish he did not become so upset.</subtitle>
